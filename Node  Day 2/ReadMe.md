//2 Ways of interacting with the system
//a.CLI
//b.Graphics user interface

// importance of CLI -:

// 1.Settting up Servers
// 2.CLI skills needed for cloud
// 3.Less resource intensive
//pwd - presnt working directory
//cd
//ls
//cd..
//mkdir
//touch
//cd "name of folder";
//npm init-->fill details
// shortcut npm init -y --> yes to everything
// npm i <npm package>
// npm uninstall <package name>
Types of Node Modules :-

1.Inbuilt modules -->pre installed in node

2.External modules --> written by someone else and we can install and use them,just like apps on google store. We use npmjs.com to browse modules

3.Third party modules--> modules custom written by developers(us) ourselves

//lets check in the logic

//My Project is dependant on isEven and Iseven is dependant on isOdd.
// isOdd is dependant on isNumber
//isNumber is dependant on kind-of dependancy
//kind-of dependant on is-buffer
//is-buffer is dependant on nothing

//package-lock.json is summary of all the packages and their dependencies
